<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field  specifies  the calculation parameter  for the field ACTY.PROD.CD.

It is possible to map to the field ACTY.PROD.CD in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:
'DEC*abcde' where DEC is a Pre-defined Operator and 'abcde' is a Tag Name defined in the field DEC.TYPE.
'CAL*pqrst' where CAL is a Pre-defined Operator and 'pqrst' is a Tag Name defined in the field CAL.TYPE.
'REP*vwxyz' where REP is a Pre-defined Operator and 'vwxyz' is a Tag Name defined in the field REPLAC.TYPE.


Example for CAL  Operator in '.CAL'  fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE: 
ID: 
DRAWINGS*DISCOUNT

INT.KEY: 
DISCOUNT.RATE (Field Name whose value is used for calculation)

INT.KEY.CAL: 
CAL*RATE (CAL-Operator, RATE-Tag Name)

CAL.TYPE: 
RATE (Tag Name)

CALC.OPERAND: 
ADD (Operand for calculation)

CALC.FIELD: 
LOAD.RATE (Field Name whose value is used for calculation)

The value of INT.KEY in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as the sum of values in the fields DISCOUNT.RATE and  LOAD.RATE.



Example  for REP Operator in '.CAL' fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE: 
ID: 
DRAWINGS*DISCOUNT

CURRENCY.MARKET: 
LC.ID (A local ref. Field in DRAWINGS whose value would be used to relate to a record in the application specified in the field  REPLAC.FILE)

CCY.MKT.CAL: 
REP*MKT (REP-Operator, MKT-Tag Name)

REPLAC.TYPE: 
MKT (Tag Name)

REPLAC.FILE: 
LETTER.OF.CREDIT (Related Application  Name)

REPLAC.FIELD: 
CURRENCY.MARKET (Field in the Related Application)

The value of  CURRENCY.MARKET in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as the value of the field CURRENCY.MARKET in the LC record whose ID is equal to the value of the field LC.ID in the DRAWINGS record. 



Example  for DEC Operator in '.CAL' fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE
: 
ID: 
DX.TRADE*FXP-PRI

ASST.LIAB.CD

DEC.ANSWER: 
2 (Value Returned)

DEC.FIELD: 
PRI.BUY.SELL (Field whose value would be compared)

DEC.OPERAND: 
EQ (Operand for Comparison)

DEC.VALUE: 
SELL


The value of  ASST.LIAB.CD in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as ' 1'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'BUY' and  it would be mapped as ' 2'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'SELL'.  


A subroutine (prefixed with @ character) could be also specified in this field to return a value which could be mapped to the  field ACTY.PROD.CD of  
PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
. 

The sub-routine specified in the '.CAL' field could have only two parameters both separated by a , the first parameter being the output parameter and the second parameter being the input parameter. If there is more than one input parameter, they could be specified in the second parameter separated by the delimiter :. 


Example for Subroutine in the '.CAL' fields:



To map the output of a sub-routine DX.DATES (with output parameter RETURN.DATE and input parameters CONTRACT.CODE, MAT.PERIOD, DATE.TO.RETURN and RETURN.CODE) to the field 
VALUE.DATE 
of PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY:


PM.GROUP.TYPE:

DX.TRADE*FXP-PRI


VALUE.DATE: 
(No value)


VAL.DT.CAL: 
@DX.DATES(RETURN.DATE,CONTRACT.CODE:MAT.PERIOD:DATE.TO.RETURN:RETURN.CODE)



Validation Rules:


If a calculation parameter is     specified, then the value should be of the format: 'Pre-defined Operator*Tag     Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or     'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields     DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined     Operator.  
If a sub-routine is attached     to this field,  it should be pre-fixed with '@' character.
If a sub-routine is attached     to this field, it should have been defined in PGM.FILE with TYPE=S.

If the     value of this field begins with characters other than '@' or 'DEC', then a     value in ACTY.PROD.CD is mandatory. 

If the     value of this field begins with characters  '@' or 'DEC', then a value     in ACTY.PROD.CD is not allowed.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field  specifies  the calculation parameter  for the field EQUIV.CODE.

It is possible to map to the field EQUIV.CODE in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:
'DEC*abcde' where DEC is a Pre-defined Operator and 'abcde' is a Tag Name defined in the field DEC.TYPE.
'CAL*pqrst' where CAL is a Pre-defined Operator and 'pqrst' is a Tag Name defined in the field CAL.TYPE.
'REP*vwxyz' where REP is a Pre-defined Operator and 'vwxyz' is a Tag Name defined in the field REPLAC.TYPE.


Example for CAL  Operator in '.CAL'  fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE: 
ID: 
DRAWINGS*DISCOUNT

INT.KEY: 
DISCOUNT.RATE (Field Name whose value is used for calculation)

INT.KEY.CAL: 
CAL*RATE (CAL-Operator, RATE-Tag Name)

CAL.TYPE: 
RATE (Tag Name)

CALC.OPERAND: 
ADD (Operand for calculation)

CALC.FIELD: 
LOAD.RATE (Field Name whose value is used for calculation)

The value of INT.KEY in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as the sum of values in the fields DISCOUNT.RATE and  LOAD.RATE.



Example  for REP Operator in '.CAL' fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE: 
ID: 
DRAWINGS*DISCOUNT

CURRENCY.MARKET: 
LC.ID (A local ref. Field in DRAWINGS whose value would be used to relate to a record in the application specified in the field  REPLAC.FILE)

CCY.MKT.CAL: 
REP*MKT (REP-Operator, MKT-Tag Name)

REPLAC.TYPE: 
MKT (Tag Name)

REPLAC.FILE: 
LETTER.OF.CREDIT (Related Application  Name)

REPLAC.FIELD: 
CURRENCY.MARKET (Field in the Related Application)

The value of  CURRENCY.MARKET in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as the value of the field CURRENCY.MARKET in the LC record whose ID is equal to the value of the field LC.ID in the DRAWINGS record. 



Example  for DEC Operator in '.CAL' fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE
: 
ID: 
DX.TRADE*FXP-PRI

ASST.LIAB.CD
: 
(No value)

AST.LIB.CAL
: 
DEC*ASST.LIAB (DEC-Operator, ASST.LIAB-Tag Name)

DEC.TYPE:

ASST.LIAB


DEC.ANSWER: 
1 (Value Returned)

DEC.FIELD: 
PRI.BUY.SELL (Field whose value would be compared)

DEC.OPERAND: 
EQ (Operand for Comparison)

DEC.VALUE: 
BUY (Value compared to)

DEC.ANSWER: 
2 (Value Returned)

DEC.FIELD: 
PRI.BUY.SELL (Field whose value would be compared)

DEC.OPERAND: 
EQ (Operand for Comparison)

DEC.VALUE: 
SELL


The value of  ASST.LIAB.CD in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as ' 1'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'BUY' and  it would be mapped as ' 2'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'SELL'.  


A subroutine (prefixed with @ character) could be also specified in this field to return a value which could be mapped to the  field EQUIV.CODE of  
PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
. 

The sub-routine specified in the '.CAL' field could have only two parameters both separated by a , the first parameter being the output parameter and the second parameter being the input parameter. If there is more than one input parameter, they could be specified in the second parameter separated by the delimiter :. 


Example for Subroutine in the '.CAL' fields:



To map the output of a sub-routine DX.DATES (with output parameter RETURN.DATE and input parameters CONTRACT.CODE, MAT.PERIOD, DATE.TO.RETURN and RETURN.CODE) to the field 
VALUE.DATE 
of PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY:


PM.GROUP.TYPE: 
ID: 
DX.TRADE*FXP-PRI


VALUE.DATE: 
(No value)


VAL.DT.CAL: 
@DX.DATES(RETURN.DATE,CONTRACT.CODE:MAT.PERIOD:DATE.TO.RETURN:RETURN.CODE)



Validation Rules:


If a calculation parameter is     specified, then the value should be of the format: 'Pre-defined Operator*Tag     Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or     'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields     DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined     Operator.  
If a sub-routine is attached     to this field,  it should be pre-fixed with '@' character.
If a sub-routine is attached     to this field, it should have been defined in PGM.FILE with TYPE=S.

If the     value of this field begins with characters other than '@' or 'DEC', then a     value in EQUIV.CODE is mandatory. 

If the     value of this field begins with characters  '@' or 'DEC', then a value     in EQUIV.CODE is not allowed.

This field  specifies  the calculation parameter  for the field VALUE.DATE.SFX.

It is possible to map to the field VALUE.DATE.SFX in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:
'DEC*abcde' where DEC is a Pre-defined Operator and 'abcde' is a Tag Name defined in the field DEC.TYPE.
'CAL*pqrst' where CAL is a Pre-defined Operator and 'pqrst' is a Tag Name defined in the field CAL.TYPE.
'REP*vwxyz' where REP is a Pre-defined Operator and 'vwxyz' is a Tag Name defined in the field REPLAC.TYPE.

It is possible to map to the field ASST.LIAB.CD in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:
'DEC*abcde' where DEC is a Pre-defined Operator and 'abcde' is a Tag Name defined in the field DEC.TYPE.
'CAL*pqrst' where CAL is a Pre-defined Operator and 'pqrst' is a Tag Name defined in the field CAL.TYPE.

It is possible to map to the field CCY.AMT in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:
'DEC*abcde' where DEC is a Pre-defined Operator and 'abcde' is a Tag Name defined in the field DEC.TYPE.
'CAL*pqrst' where CAL is a Pre-defined Operator and 'pqrst' is a Tag Name defined in the field CAL.TYPE.

A subroutine (prefixed with @ character) could be also specified in this field to return a value which could be mapped to the  field CCY.AMT of  
PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
. 

The sub-routine specified in the '.CAL' field could have only two parameters both separated by a , the first parameter being the output parameter and the second parameter being the input parameter. If there is more than one input parameter, they could be specified in the second parameter separated by the delimiter :.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field  specifies  the calculation parameter  for the field CURRENCY.MARKET. 

It is possible to map to the field CURRENCY.MARKET in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:
'DEC*abcde' where DEC is a Pre-defined Operator and 'abcde' is a Tag Name defined in the field DEC.TYPE.
'CAL*pqrst' where CAL is a Pre-defined Operator and 'pqrst' is a Tag Name defined in the field CAL.TYPE.
'REP*vwxyz' where REP is a Pre-defined Operator and 'vwxyz' is a Tag Name defined in the field REPLAC.TYPE.


Example for CAL  Operator in '.CAL'  fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE: 
ID: 
DRAWINGS*DISCOUNT

INT.KEY: 
DISCOUNT.RATE (Field Name whose value is used for calculation)

INT.KEY.CAL: 
CAL*RATE (CAL-Operator, RATE-Tag Name)

CAL.TYPE: 
RATE (Tag Name)

CALC.OPERAND: 
ADD (Operand for calculation)

CALC.FIELD: 
LOAD.RATE (Field Name whose value is used for calculation)

The value of INT.KEY in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as the sum of values in the fields DISCOUNT.RATE and  LOAD.RATE.



Example  for REP Operator in '.CAL' fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE: 
ID: 
DRAWINGS*DISCOUNT

CURRENCY.MARKET: 
LC.ID (A local ref. Field in DRAWINGS whose value would be used to relate to a record in the application specified in the field  REPLAC.FILE)

CCY.MKT.CAL: 
REP*MKT (REP-Operator, MKT-Tag Name)

REPLAC.TYPE: 
MKT (Tag Name)

REPLAC.FILE: 
LETTER.OF.CREDIT (Related Application  Name)

REPLAC.FIELD: 
CURRENCY.MARKET (Field in the Related Application)

The value of  CURRENCY.MARKET in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as the value of the field CURRENCY.MARKET in the LC record whose ID is equal to the value of the field LC.ID in the DRAWINGS record. 



Example  for DEC Operator in '.CAL' fields:

PM.GROUP.TYPE
: 
ID: 
DX.TRADE*FXP-PRI

ASST.LIAB.CD
:

DEC.ANSWER: 
2 (Value Returned)

DEC.FIELD: 
PRI.BUY.SELL (Field whose value would be compared)

DEC.OPERAND: 
EQ (Operand for Comparison)

DEC.VALUE: 
SELL


The value of  ASST.LIAB.CD in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as ' 1'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'BUY' and  it would be mapped as ' 2'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'SELL'.  


A subroutine (prefixed with

It is possible to map to the field DEALER.DESK in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:

This field  specifies  the calculation parameter  for the field INT.KEY.

It is possible to map to the field INT.KEY in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
, a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP or by attaching a sub-routine in this field.
If the pre-defined Operators are specified in this field, they should be specified in the  format:  'Pre-defined Operator*Tag Name', where the 'Pre-defined Operator' could be either 'DEC', 'CAL' or 'REP' and the 'Tag Name'  is the value specified in the  fields DEC.TYPE or CAL.TYPE or REPLAC.TYPE depending on the  Pre-defined Operator.  

Example:

This field could have the following values:

It is also possible to map to the field MARGIN  in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY a value returned by a  routine, or a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP. When the operators CAL or REP is specified, the value in this field would be used by the operators  for determining the value to be mapped.

The pre-defined operators or the routine could be specified in the '.CAL'  field which is next to the  field used for mapping.  

Example for direct mapping of values:

PM.GROUP.TYPE:

ID: 
MG.MORTGAGE*DEFAULT

CURRENCY.MARKET: 
"1" (Constant 1 mapped)

CCY.MKT.CAL: 
No value.

INT.KEY: 
EFFECTIVE.INT  (Value of the Field EFFECTIVE.INT  is mapped)

INT.KEY.CAL: 
No value.


Validation Rules:



Value     mandatory if  the field 
 has a     value other than those starting with '@' or 'DEC'.

Value not     allowed if the field 
 has a value     starting with '@' or 'DEC'.

Should be     name of  a valid field of the Application defined in the ID or it could     be a constant enclosed in double quotes.

Example:

This field could have the following values:
'DEC*abcde' where DEC is a Pre-defined Operator and 'abcde' is a Tag Name defined in the field DEC.TYPE.
'CAL*pqrst' where CAL is a Pre-defined Operator and 'pqrst' is a Tag Name defined in the field CAL.TYPE.

1 (Value Returned)

DEC.FIELD: 
PRI.BUY.SELL (Field whose value would be compared)

DEC.OPERAND: 
EQ (Operand for Comparison)

DEC.VALUE: 
BUY (Value compared to)

DEC.ANSWER: 
2 (Value Returned)

DEC.FIELD: 
PRI.BUY.SELL (Field whose value would be compared)

DEC.OPERAND:

DEC.VALUE: 
SELL


The value of  ASST.LIAB.CD in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY in this case would be mapped as ' 1'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'BUY' and  it would be mapped as ' 2'  if the value of the field PRI.BUY.SELL is equal to 'SELL'.  


A subroutine (prefixed with @ character) could be also specified in this field to return a value which could be mapped to the  field POSN.TYPE of  
PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY 
. 

The sub-routine specified in the '.CAL' field could have only two parameters both separated by a , the first parameter being the output parameter and the second parameter being the input parameter. If there is more than one input parameter, they could be specified in the second parameter separated by the delimiter :. 


Example for Subroutine in the '.CAL' fields:



To map the output of a sub-routine DX.DATES (with output parameter RETURN.DATE and input parameters CONTRACT.CODE, MAT.PERIOD, DATE.TO.RETURN and RETURN.CODE) to the field 
VALUE.DATE 
of PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY:


PM.GROUP.TYPE:

Either the     field VALUE.DATE.SFX or 
 should have a     value.

Should be     name of  a valid field of the Application defined in the ID or it could     be a constant enclosed in double quotes.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Specifies the value which could  be used to map to the field VALUE.DATE.SFX in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY (PM Gap movement details  for   the  Application and Group specified in the ID). 
A valid field from the application specified in the ID or a Constant (in double quotes) could be entered here.
A part  of the ID could be also specified here by defining the value as  '@ID[x,y]', which would return a value of 'y' characters from the x th character of the ID of the transaction record.  

It is also possible to map to the field VALUE.DATE.SFX  in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY a value returned by a  routine, or a value returned after processing by pre-defined operators of DEC or CAL or REP. When the operators CAL or REP is specified, the value in this field would be used by the operators  for determining the value to be mapped.

The pre-defined operators or the routine could be specified in the '.CAL'  field which is next to the  field used for mapping.  

Example for direct mapping of values:

PM.GROUP.TYPE:

ID: 
MG.MORTGAGE*DEFAULT

CURRENCY.MARKET: 
"1" (Constant 1 mapped)

CCY.MKT.CAL: 
No value.

INT.KEY: 
EFFECTIVE.INT  (Value of the Field EFFECTIVE.INT  is mapped)

INT.KEY.CAL: 
No value.

Validation Rules:



Value     mandatory if  the field 
 has a     value other than those starting with '@' or 'DEC'.

Value not     allowed if the field 
 has a value     starting with '@' or 'DEC'.

Either the     field VALUE.DATE.SFX or 
 should have a     value.

Should be     name of  a valid field of the Application defined in the ID or it could     be a constant enclosed in double quotes.
