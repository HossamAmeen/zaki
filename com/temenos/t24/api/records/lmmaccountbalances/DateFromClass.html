<p><b>Field description:</b>
The date that a change in the principal of the contract is processed.  This is not necessarily the value date of the principal change. 
This field, along with the following six fields records the principal movements of the contract.  Whenever there is a movement in principal then the process date that the movement is input to the System is written to this field, the value date of the movement is written to EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3), the amount is written to TRANS PRIN AMT (Field 4), and the principal balances (Fields 5 to 8) are updated accordingly.  So as to keep the history of principal movements, these fields are multivalue associated and each time there is a movement, rather than overwrite the fields existing values, a new 'set of values' are added. 
This field will always contain the same value as in EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3) except in the following two cases: 
1.        When a back valued contract or principal increase in           loaded. 
          In this, the DATE FROM field will contain the date           that the change was input and the EFFECTIVE DATE           field will contain the value date of the change. 
2.        When the LD.RECEIPT.ENTRY, MM.PAYMENT.ENTRY           or MM.RECEIPT.ENTRY applications are used to           record principal decreases with a value date different           to the process date.  In this case the process date will           be in the DATE FROM field and the value date of the           decrease will be in the EFFECTIVE DATE field. 
An example of the operation of this field and the other principal fields appears in the details of EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3). 
Validation Rules:

Standard date format of 11 characters. Multivalue associated with fields 3 to 8.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The date when the contract had the principal balance and movement as shown by the following five fields. 
This field, along with the following five fields records the principal movements of the contract. Whenever there is a movement in principal (e.g. a drawdown) then the value date of that movement is written into this field, the date the drawdown was input is written to DATE FROM (Field 2), the principal movement amount is written to TRANS PRIN AMT (Field 4), and the principal balances (fields 5 to 8) are updated accordingly. So as to keep the history of principal movements, these fields are multivalue associated and each time there is a movement, rather than overwrite the fields existing values, a new 'set of values' are added. 
Example:  An example of the possible movements is shown below: 
Event 1:  A 12,000 US dollar placement is loaded onto the system           on 11th February 1987, valued 16th February 1987 and           maturing on 23rd February 1987. 
Event 2:  During the 'off-line' processing of 16th February, the           placement moves from a 'Forward valued' asset, to a           'Current' asset. 
Event 3:  During the 'off-line' processing of 23rd February, the           placement matures with the principal becoming due           and then being fully repaid.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The current outstanding principal on the contract (excluding pre-payments) as of the 'EFFECTIVE DATE' field in this multivalue set of fields (fields 2 to 8). 
This field, along with fields 2 to 8 records the principal movements of the contract. Whenever there is a movement in principal (e.g. a drawdown) then the process date of that movement is written into DATE FROM (Field 2), the value date is written into EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3),the principal movement amount is written into TRANS PRIN AMT (Field 4), and the principal balances (fields 5 to 8) are updated accordingly. So as to keep the history of principal movements, these fields are multivalue associated and each time there is a movement, rather than overwrite the fields existing values, a new 'set of values' are added. 
This OUTS CURR PRINC field will only contain an amount (other than zero) when a contract has a value date less than or equal to the process date, and in the case of a fixed maturity contract, a maturity date greater than or equal to the process date. This field, along with fields 6 to 8, can have negative values (shown by a negative sign preceding the number) and positive values (shown with no sign preceding the number). Asset contracts with amounts outstanding are signed negative (as are pre-payments on deposits in the OUTS OD PRINC field); and liability contracts with amounts outstanding are positive (as are pre-payments on asset contracts in the OUTS OD PRINC field). 
To obtain the 'net' amount of principal outstanding (i.e. including pre-payments), this field needs to be added to the following field, OUTS OD PRINC (Field 6). 
An example of the possible movements is shown in the details of EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3). 
Validation Rules:

Up to 14 AMT (standard amount format) type characters plus decimal point. Multivalue associated with fields 2 to 8.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The current outstanding principal on the contract that is due to be paid/received  as of the 'DATE FROM field in this multivalue set of fields (fields 2 to 8). 
This field, along with fields 2 to 8 records the principal movements of the contract. Whenever there is a movement in principal (e.g. a drawdown) then the process date of that movement is written into DATE FROM (Field 2), the value date is written into EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3) the principal movement amount is written into TRANS PRIN AMT (Field 4), and the principal balances (fields 5 to 8) are updated accordingly. So as to keep the history of principal movements, these fields are multivalue associated and each time there is a movement, rather than overwrite the fields existing values, a new 'set of values' are added. 
This OUTS OD PRINC field will only contain an amount (other than zero) in two situations: 
(i)       For LD contracts that have a scheduled principal           amount due for payment but not yet liquidated due to           non-receipt of funds. 
(ii)      Whenever there is a pre-payment of principal through           the LD.RECEIPT.ENTRY, MM.RECEIPT.ENTRY or           MM.PAYMENT.ENTRY applications. In this situation           the sign of the amount will always be opposite to the           sign in the OUTS CURR PRINC field. (To calculate the           net outstanding principal on a contract, i.e. taking           pre-payments into account, this field should be added           to OUTS CURR PRINC (Field 6). 
This field, along with fields 6 to 8, can have negative values (shown by a negative sign preceding the number) and positive values (shown with no sign preceding the number). Asset contracts with amounts outstanding are signed negative (as are pre-payments on deposits); and liability contracts with amounts outstanding are positive (as are pre-payments on asset contracts). 
An example of the possible movements is shown in the details of EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3).

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The amount of overdue principal outstanding on the contract after the principal movement has been effected when it is on a non-accrual basis. 
When the contract is put on a non-accrual basis all the outstanding principal is moved to this field.  This is done by the routine LD.NAB.TRANSFER during the end of day processing when the number of days after the contract has become overdue when it should go to NAB as defined on the LMM.INSTALL.CONDS record is reached. 
It is also used by the receipt entry system in respect of the liquidation of outstanding principal on an "NAB" basis. 
Associated Field Considerations. 
The multivalue associated fields DATE FROM to OUTS PRINC NAB hold the history of all principal movements to the contract. They are maintained for all contract types. 
The associated fields are as follows:- 
          DATE FROM           EFFECTIVE DATE           TRANS PRIN AMT           OUTS FWD PRINC           OUTS CURR PRINC           OUTS OD PRINC           OUTS PRINC NAB 
Each multivalue set in the association records details of the particular movement which occurred on the date in the field DATE FROM. 
These fields hold historic data with the exception of the last multivalue association which shows the current principal position of the contract. 
Validation Rules:

Upto 14 AMT (Standard amount format) type characters plus decimal point. Multivalue association with fields 2 to 8. (For LD.Loans and deposits only.)

The transaction amount that has affected the principal balances on the contract. 
This field, along with fields 2 to 8 records the principal movements of the contract. Whenever there is a movement in principal (e.g. a drawdown) then the value date of that movement is written into EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3), the process date of the movement is written into DATE FROM (Field 2), the principal movement amount is written into this field, and the principal balances (fields 5 to 8) are updated accordingly. So as to keep the history of principal movements, these fields are multivalue associated and each time there is a movement, rather than overwrite the fields existing values, a new 'set of values' are added. 
This TRANS PRIN AMT field will contain an amount WHENEVER there is a principal movement, irrespective of whether there is a movement of funds into or out of the bank. e.g. it will show an amount when a current contract becomes 'due' as well as when the due amount is liquidated. This field can have negative values (shown by a negative sign preceding the number) and positive values (shown with no sign preceding the number). 
Movements on asset contracts are always shown as negative values except for reductions in principal which are shown as positive. 
Movements on liability contracts are always shown as positive values except for reductions in principal which are shown as negative. 
An example of the possible movements is shown in the details of EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3).

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The current outstanding principal on the contract that is due to be paid/received  as of the 'DATE FROM field in this multivalue set of fields (fields 2 to 8). 
This field, along with fields 2 to 8 records the principal movements of the contract. Whenever there is a movement in principal (e.g. a drawdown) then the process date of that movement is written into DATE FROM (Field 2), the value date is written into EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3) the principal movement amount is written into TRANS PRIN AMT (Field 4), and the principal balances (fields 5 to 8) are updated accordingly. So as to keep the history of principal movements, these fields are multivalue associated and each time there is a movement, rather than overwrite the fields existing values, a new 'set of values' are added. 
This OUTS OD PRINC field will only contain an amount (other than zero) in two situations: 
(i)       For LD contracts that have a scheduled principal           amount due for payment but not yet liquidated due to           non-receipt of funds. 
(ii)      Whenever there is a pre-payment of principal through           the LD.RECEIPT.ENTRY, MM.RECEIPT.ENTRY or           MM.PAYMENT.ENTRY applications. In this situation           the sign of the amount will always be opposite to the           sign in the OUTS CURR PRINC field. (To calculate the           net outstanding principal on a contract, i.e. taking           pre-payments into account, this field should be added           to OUTS CURR PRINC (Field 6). 
This field, along with fields 6 to 8, can have negative values (shown by a negative sign preceding the number) and positive values (shown with no sign preceding the number). Asset contracts with amounts outstanding are signed negative (as are pre-payments on deposits); and liability contracts with amounts outstanding are positive (as are pre-payments on asset contracts). 
An example of the possible movements is shown in the details of EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3).

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The amount of overdue principal outstanding on the contract after the principal movement has been effected when it is on a non-accrual basis. 
When the contract is put on a non-accrual basis all the outstanding principal is moved to this field.  This is done by the routine LD.NAB.TRANSFER during the end of day processing when the number of days after the contract has become overdue when it should go to NAB as defined on the LMM.INSTALL.CONDS record is reached. 
It is also used by the receipt entry system in respect of the liquidation of outstanding principal on an "NAB" basis. 
Associated Field Considerations. 
The multivalue associated fields DATE FROM to OUTS PRINC NAB hold the history of all principal movements to the contract. They are maintained for all contract types. 
The associated fields are as follows:- 
          DATE FROM           EFFECTIVE DATE           TRANS PRIN AMT           OUTS FWD PRINC           OUTS CURR PRINC           OUTS OD PRINC           OUTS PRINC NAB 
Each multivalue set in the association records details of the particular movement which occurred on the date in the field DATE FROM. 
These fields hold historic data with the exception of the last multivalue association which shows the current principal position of the contract.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The transaction amount that has affected the principal balances on the contract. 
This field, along with fields 2 to 8 records the principal movements of the contract. Whenever there is a movement in principal (e.g. a drawdown) then the value date of that movement is written into EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3), the process date of the movement is written into DATE FROM (Field 2), the principal movement amount is written into this field, and the principal balances (fields 5 to 8) are updated accordingly. So as to keep the history of principal movements, these fields are multivalue associated and each time there is a movement, rather than overwrite the fields existing values, a new 'set of values' are added. 
This TRANS PRIN AMT field will contain an amount WHENEVER there is a principal movement, irrespective of whether there is a movement of funds into or out of the bank. e.g. it will show an amount when a current contract becomes 'due' as well as when the due amount is liquidated. This field can have negative values (shown by a negative sign preceding the number) and positive values (shown with no sign preceding the number). 
Movements on asset contracts are always shown as negative values except for reductions in principal which are shown as positive. 
Movements on liability contracts are always shown as positive values except for reductions in principal which are shown as negative. 
An example of the possible movements is shown in the details of EFFECTIVE DATE (Field 3). 
Validation Rules:

Up to 14 AMT (standard amount format) type characters plus decimal point. Multivalue associated with fields 2 to 7.
