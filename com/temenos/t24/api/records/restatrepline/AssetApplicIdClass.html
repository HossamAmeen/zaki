<p><b>Field description:</b>
The Fields 25.1 to 36.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic. ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Validation Rules:



As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET &amp; LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

The Fields 25.1 to 36.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic. ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Validation Rules:



As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET &amp; LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

The Fields 25.1 to 36.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic. ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Validation Rules:



As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET &amp; LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

Validation Rules:



As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET &amp; LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

The Fields 25.1 to 36.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

The Fields 25.1 to 36.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

The Fields 25.1 to 36.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Validation Rules:



As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET &amp; LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".

Validation Rules:



As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET &amp; LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB".

The Fields 25.1 to 36.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The prompts (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1 NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Identifies the application to be included in this line.
The presently allowed values (see below) are hard coded and additional applications to be included in the consolidation/reporting process need to be added in form of a program change.
The variables in Fields 21.1, 22.1, 23.1 and 24.1 constitute the fixed part of any Asset and Liability consolidation key.


Example:   When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field.  A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included.  This match is done by a priority basis.  The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

The variables in Fields 21.1, 22.1, 23.1 and 24.1 constitute the fixed part of any Asset and Liability consolidation key.


Example:   When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field.  A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included.  This match is done by a priority basis.  The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 36.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, APPLIC ID.
