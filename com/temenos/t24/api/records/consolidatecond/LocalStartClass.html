<p><b>Field description:</b>
This is the code (value) under which a range defined in fields LOCAL.START and LOCAL.END or a REST defined in LOCAL.START will be aggregated. 
The fields LOCAL.START  to LCL.COMBINED are used in determining what value is stored in the CRF key.  Where the initial amount or initial time option is being used, LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers, the entered here are a set of tables with the last entry being REST, in this case the LOCAL.END is never used.  Where a single field number is entered in the LOCAL.FIELD.NO then details contained here are replacement details. 
Examples of the different conditions now follow. 

Example A:  Single Field number in LOCAL.FIELD.NO. 
LOCAL.FIELD.NO is BOE code. Values on the file are BOE codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows: 
   o         Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3; 
   o         Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single              aggregation; 
   o         Combination of the remaining values into a single              aggregation. 
Input is as follows: 
Field No        Field Name        Field Value ========        ==========        =========== 12.1.1          LOCAL.START       1 13.1.1          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.1          LCL.COMBINED      1 12.1.2          LOCAL.START       2 13.1.2          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.2          LCL.COMBINED      2 12.1.3          LOCAL.START       3 13.1.3          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.3          LCL.COMBINED      3 12.1.4          LOCAL.START       4 13.1.4          LOCAL.END         7 14.1.4          LCL.COMBINED      ANY VALID VALUE 12.1.5          LOCAL.START       REST 13.1.5          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.5          LCL.COMBINED      ANY VALID VALUE 

Example B: 
Money Market deals are to be broken down into the following pound or pound equivalents of: 
   -         500,000 and below    -         500,000.01 to 1,000,000    -         1,000,000.01 to 5,000,000    -         and any over 5,000,000 
Then the appropriate fields would be set up as follows: 
CONSOLIDATION COND 
Field No        Field Name        Field Value ========        ==========        =========== 8.1             APPLICATION       MONEY MARKET 9.1             LOCAL FILE NAME   MM.MONEY.MARKET 10.1            LOCAL FIELD NAME  3/2 11.1            LOCAL CCY         GBP 12.1.1          LOCAL START       500,000 13.1.1          LOCAL END         - 14.1.1          LCL COMBINED      1 12.1.2          LOCAL START       1,000,000 13.1.2          LOCAL END         - 14.1.2          LCL COMBINED      2 12.1.3          LOCAL START       5,000,000 13.1.3          LOCAL END         - 14.1.3          LCL COMBINED      3 12.1.4          LOCAL START       REST 13.1.4          LOCAL END         - 14.1.4          LCL COMBINED      9 

Example C:  Initial Time 
Money Market deals are to be split as follows: 
-         Those at Call -         Up to 7 Days Notice -         Up to 30 Days Notice -         Term of up to 7 days -         Term of up to 1 month (excluding those up to 7 days -         Term of up to 6 months -         Term of up to 1 year -         rest which will be any notice period greater than 30 days           and any term over 1 year. 
Note:     Term is decided as the difference between the value date           and Maturity date. 
The appropriate fields on CONSOLIDATE COND would be set up as follows:

Notes : (i) The details entered in fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END             are only relevant for the application entered in APPLICATION.             Though the same variable component in the Consolidation Record             key can be used by more than one application, the meaning may             be different for each application. 
       (ii) The fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are only used for the             Asset and Liability record.  There can not be entries for             Profit and Loss details. 
      (iii) There should be an entry in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to             CON.ON.END for each application that is on the company record             and each occurrence of 'LOCAL' in FILE.NAME.             For those occurrences where an application has no entry,             then at the validation stage an override message is output             (the  message is "Application Name HAS NO ENTRY FOR No X"). 
       (iv) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the             record exists.  If the record does not exist but the value             is a possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD             CURRENTLY NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not             treated as an error.  This allows for ranges to be loaded             when only part of the range is currently in use. 
        (v) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those             entered are to be combined under one code.             When REST is not entered, then the missing values keep their             own value.  When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers             value REST must be entered. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Subvalue field, associated with fields LOCAL.START and LOCAL.END, multivalue association with field range APPLICATION to LOCAL.START and CON.ON.FILE to CON.ON.END.  Optional input.
Input must be a possible valid value of the file specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME. If LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
Validation rules as defined in the application LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in the LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply if it is a single field number.
Input is only allowed if LOCAL.START has been used.
Input is mandatory when LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers then at least two sets of 'conditions' must be present.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
The last value in a range (start of range is in LOCAL.START) for the accumulation of fields into a combined code. 
To illustrate the use of the fields LOCAL.END to LCL.COMBINED the following example is used, which is also included in the "details section" of the fields LOCAL.START and LCL.COMBINED.  This field is not used for initial amount and time options and thus those examples are not included here. 

Example A: 
LOCAL.FIELD.NO is BOE code. Values on the file are BOE codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows: 
   o         Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3; 
   o         Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single              aggregation;

Notes : (i) The details entered in fields MULTI.VALU.NO to CON.ON.END are             only relevant for the application entered in APPLICATION.             Though the same variable component in the Consolidation Record             key can be used by more than one application, the meaning may             be different for each application. 
       (ii) The fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are only used for the             Asset and Liability record. 
      (iii) There should be an entry in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to             CON.ON.END for each application that is on the company record             and each occurrence of 'LOCAL' in FILE.NAME.             For those occurrences where an application has no entry,             then at the validation stage an override message is output             (the  message is "Application Name HAS NO ENTRY FOR No X"). 
       (iv) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the record             exists.  If the record does not exist but the value is a             possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY             NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error.             This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the             range is currently in use. 
        (v) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those             entered are to be combined under one code.  When REST is not             entered, then the missing values keep their own value. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Subvalue field, associated with fields LOCAL.START and LCL.COMBINED, multivalue association with fields APPLICATION to LOCAL.START and CON.ON.END.  Optional input.
Input must be a possible valid value of the field specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME.
Validation rules as defined in the application specified in field LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in the field LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply.
If field LOCAL.START is equal to REST, no input is allowed.
If LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers then no input is allowed.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value.
If field LOCAL.START has not been entered, then no input is allowed here.
Value must be greater than LOCAL.START.

Notes : (i) The details entered in fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END             are only relevant for the application entered in APPLICATION.             Though the same variable component in the Consolidation Record             key can be used by more than one application, the meaning may             be different for each application. 
       (ii) The fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are only used for the             Asset and Liability record.  There can not be entries for             Profit and Loss details. 
      (iii) There should be an entry in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to             CON.ON.END for each application that is on the company record             and each occurrence of 'LOCAL' in FILE.NAME.             For those occurrences where an application has no entry,             then at the validation stage an override message is output             (the  message is "Application Name HAS NO ENTRY FOR No X"). 
       (iv) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the             record exists.  If the record does not exist but the value             is a possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD             CURRENTLY NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not             treated as an error.  This allows for ranges to be loaded             when only part of the range is currently in use. 
        (v) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those             entered are to be combined under one code.             When REST is not entered, then the missing values keep their             own value.  When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers             value REST must be entered. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Subvalue field, associated with fields LOCAL.START and LOCAL.END, multivalue association with field range APPLICATION to LOCAL.START and CON.ON.FILE to CON.ON.END.  Optional input.
Input must be a possible valid value of the file specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME. If LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
Validation rules as defined in the application LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in the LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply if it is a single field number.
Input is only allowed if LOCAL.START has been used.
Input is mandatory when LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers then at least two sets of 'conditions' must be present.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value.

This is the code (value) under which a range defined in fields LOCAL.START and LOCAL.END or a REST defined in LOCAL.START will be aggregated. 
The fields LOCAL.START  to LCL.COMBINED are used in determining what value is stored in the CRF key.  Where the initial amount or initial time option is being used, LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers, the entered here are a set of tables with the last entry being REST, in this case the LOCAL.END is never used.  Where a single field number is entered in the LOCAL.FIELD.NO then details contained here are replacement details. 
Examples of the different conditions now follow. 

Example A:  Single Field number in LOCAL.FIELD.NO. 
LOCAL.FIELD.NO is BOE code. Values on the file are BOE codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows: 
   o         Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3; 
   o         Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single              aggregation; 
   o         Combination of the remaining values into a single              aggregation.

Notes : (i) The details entered in fields MULTI.VALU.NO to CON.ON.END are             only relevant for the application entered in APPLICATION.             Though the same variable component in the Consolidation Record             key can be used by more than one application, the meaning may             be different for each application. 
       (ii) The fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are only used for the             Asset and Liability record. 
      (iii) There should be an entry in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to             CON.ON.END for each application that is on the company record             and each occurrence of 'LOCAL' in FILE.NAME.             For those occurrences where an application has no entry,             then at the validation stage an override message is output             (the  message is "Application Name HAS NO ENTRY FOR No X"). 
       (iv) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the record             exists.  If the record does not exist but the value is a             possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY             NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error.             This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the             range is currently in use. 
        (v) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those             entered are to be combined under one code.  When REST is not             entered, then the missing values keep their own value. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Subvalue field, associated with fields LOCAL.START and LCL.COMBINED, multivalue association with fields APPLICATION to LOCAL.START and CON.ON.END.  Optional input.
Input must be a possible valid value of the field specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME.
Validation rules as defined in the application specified in field LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in the field LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply.
If field LOCAL.START is equal to REST, no input is allowed.
If LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers then no input is allowed.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value.
If field LOCAL.START has not been entered, then no input is allowed here.
Value must be greater than LOCAL.START.

The last value in a range (start of range is in LOCAL.START) for the accumulation of fields into a combined code. 
To illustrate the use of the fields LOCAL.END to LCL.COMBINED the following example is used, which is also included in the "details section" of the fields LOCAL.START and LCL.COMBINED.  This field is not used for initial amount and time options and thus those examples are not included here. 

Example A: 
LOCAL.FIELD.NO is BOE code. Values on the file are BOE codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows: 
   o         Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3; 
   o         Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single              aggregation; 
   o         Combination of the remaining values into a single              aggregation. 
Input is as follows:

Example B: 
Money Market deals are to be broken down into the following pound or pound equivalents of: 
   -         500,000 and below    -         500,000.01 to 1,000,000    -         1,000,000.01 to 5,000,000    -         and any over 5,000,000

Example C:  Initial Time 
Money Market deals are to be split as follows: 
   -         Those at Call    -         Up to 7 Days Notice    -         Up to 30 Days Notice    -         Term of up to 7 days    -         Term of up to 1 month (excluding those up to 7 days)    -         Term of up to 6 months    -         Term of up to 1 year    -         rest which will be any notice period greater than 30 days              and any term over 1 year. 
Note : Term is decided as the difference between the value date and        Maturity date. 
The appropriate fields on CONSOLIDATE COND would be set up as follows:

Notes : (i) The details entered in fields MULTI.VALU.NO to CON.ON.END are             only relevant for the application entered in APPLICATION.             Though the same variable component in the Consolidation Record             key can be used by more than one application, the meaning may             be different for each application. 
       (ii) The fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are only used for the             Asset and Liability record. 
      (iii) There should be an entry in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to             CON.ON.END for each application that is on the company record             and each occurrence of 'LOCAL' in FILE.NAME.             For those occurrences where an application has no entry,             then at the validation stage an override message is output             (the  message is "Application Name HAS NO ENTRY FOR No X").

If the record does not exist but the value is a             possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY             NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error.             This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the             range is currently in use. 
        (v) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those             entered are to be combined under one code.  When REST is not             entered, then the missing values keep their own value. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Subvalue field, associated with fields LOCAL.START and LCL.COMBINED, multivalue association with fields APPLICATION to LOCAL.START and CON.ON.END.  Optional input.

Validation rules as defined in the application specified in field LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in the field LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply.
If field LOCAL.START is equal to REST, no input is allowed.
If LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers then no input is allowed.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value.
If field LOCAL.START has not been entered, then no input is allowed here.

The fields LOCAL.START to LCL.COMBINED are used in determining what value is stored in the CRF key.  Where the initial amount or initial time option is being used, LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers, the entered here are a set of tables with the last entry being REST, in this case the LOCAL.END is never used.  Where a single field number is entered in the LOCAL.FIELD.NO then details contained here are replacement details. 
Examples of the different conditions now follow. 
Example A:  Single Field number in LOCAL.FIELD.NO. 
LOCAL.FIELD.NO is BOE code. Values on the file are BOE codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows:

If the record does not exist but the value is a            possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY            NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error.            This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the range            is currently in use. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Sub value field, associated with LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED, multivalue association with MULTI.VALUE.NO to LOCAL.CCY and LOCAL.END to LCL.COMBINED.  Optional input when LOCAL.FIELD.NO has been entered; otherwise not allowed.
Input must be a possible valid value of the referenced file specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME or be equal to REST if LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
Validation rules as defined in the application specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply if LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value and if LOCAL.FIELD contains a single field number.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two date field numbers then the values allowed here are 0-999, ID-999D or 1M to 999M or REST.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a currency code and an amount field number then the values allowed here are numeric or REST.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers the values entered must be in ascending order and the last value must be REST.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers there must be at least two sets of 'conditions' entered.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Allows definition of a single value to be accumulated or is the beginning of a range of values to be accumulated or denotes through input of value REST accumulation of all values not specified. 
The fields LOCAL.START to LCL.COMBINED are used in determining what value is stored in the CRF key.  Where the initial amount or initial time option is being used, LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers, the entered here are a set of tables with the last entry being REST, in this case the LOCAL.END is never used.  Where a single field number is entered in the LOCAL.FIELD.NO then details contained here are replacement details. 
Examples of the different conditions now follow. 
Example A:  Single Field number in LOCAL.FIELD.NO. 
LOCAL.FIELD.NO is BOE code. Values on the file are BOE codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows: 
   o         Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3; 
   o         Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single              aggregation; 
   o         Combination of the remaining values into a single              aggregation. 
Input is as follows: 
Field No        Field Name        Field Value ========        ==========        =========== 12.1.1          LOCAL.START       1 13.1.1          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.1          LCL.COMBINED      1 12.1.2          LOCAL.START       2 13.1.2          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.2          LCL.COMBINED      2 12.1.3          LOCAL.START       3 13.1.3          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.3          LCL.COMBINED      3 12.1.4          LOCAL.START       4 13.1.4          LOCAL.END         7 14.1.4          LCL.COMBINED      ANY VALID VALUE 12.1.5          LOCAL.START       REST 13.1.5          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.5          LCL.COMBINED      ANY VALID VALUE 

Example B: 
Money Market deals are to be broken down into the following pound or pound equivalents of: 
   -         500,000 and below    -         500,000.01 to 1,000,000    -         1,000,000.01 to 5,000,000    -         and any over 5,000,000 
Then the appropriate fields would be set up as follows: 
CONSOLIDATION COND 
Field No        Field Name        Field Value ========        ==========        =========== 8.1             APPLICATION       MONEY MARKET 9.1             LOCAL.FILE.NAME   MM.MONEY.MARKET 10.1            LOCAL.FIELD.NAME  3/2 11.1            LOCAL.CCY         GBP 12.1.1          LOCAL.START       500,000 13.1.1          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.1          LCL.COMBINED      1 12.1.2          LOCAL.START       1,000,000 13.1.2          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.2          LCL.COMBINED      2 12.1.3          LOCAL.START       5,000,000 13.1.3          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.3          LCL.COMBINED      3 12.1.4          LOCAL.START       REST 13.1.4          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.4          LCL.COMBINED      9 

Example C:  Initial Time 
Money Market deals are to be split as follows: 
   -         Those at Call    -         Up to 7 Days Notice    -         Up to 30 Days Notice    -         Term of up to 7 days    -         Term of up to 1 month (excluding those up to 7 days)    -         Term of up to 6 months    -         Term of up to 1 year    -         rest which will be any notice period greater than 30 days              and any term over 1 year. 
Note : Term is decided as the difference between the value date and        Maturity date. 
The appropriate fields on CONSOLIDATE COND would be set up as follows: 
CONSOLIDATION COND 
Field No        Field Name        Field Value ========        ==========        =========== 8.1             APPLICATION       MONEY MARKET 9.1             LOCAL.FILE.NAME   MM.MONEY.MARKET 10.1            LOCAL.FIELD.NO    5/6 11.1            LOCAL.CCY         - 12.1.1          LOCAL.START       0 13.1.1          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.1          LCL.COMBINED      1 12.1.2          LOCAL.START       7 13.1.2          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.2          LCL.COMBINED      2 12.1.3          LOCAL.START       30 13.1.3          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.3          LCL.COMBINED      3 12.1.4          LOCAL.START       7D 13.1.4          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.4          LCL.COMBINED      10 12.1.5          LOCAL.START       1M 13.1.5          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.5          LCL.COMBINED      11 12.1.6          LOCAL.START       6M 13.1.6          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.6          LCL.COMBINED      12 12.1.7          LOCAL.START       12M 13.1.7          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.7          LCL.COMBINED      13 12.1.8          LOCAL.START       REST 13.1.8          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.8          LCL.COMBINED      99 

Note : (i) The details entered in fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are            only relevant for the application entered in APPLICATION.            Though the same variable component in the Consolidation Record            key can be used by more than one application, the meaning may            be different for each application. 
      (ii) The fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are only used for the            Asset and Liability record. 
     (iii) There should be an entry in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to            CON.ON.END for each application that is on the company record            and each occurrence of 'LOCAL' in FILE.NAME.            For those occurrences where an application has no entry,            then at the validation stage an override message is output            (the  message is "Application Name HAS NO ENTRY FOR No X"). 
      (iv) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those            entered are to be combined under one code.  When REST is not            entered, then the missing values keep their own value except            for when LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers when value            REST must be entered. 
       (v) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the record            exists.  If the record does not exist but the value is a            possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY            NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error.            This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the range            is currently in use. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Sub value field, associated with LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED, multivalue association with MULTI.VALUE.NO to LOCAL.CCY and LOCAL.END to LCL.COMBINED.  Optional input when LOCAL.FIELD.NO has been entered; otherwise not allowed.
Input must be a possible valid value of the referenced file specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME or be equal to REST if LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
Validation rules as defined in the application specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply if LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value and if LOCAL.FIELD contains a single field number.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two date field numbers then the values allowed here are 0-999, ID-999D or 1M to 999M or REST.
