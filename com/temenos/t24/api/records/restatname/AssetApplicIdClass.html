Fields 6.1 to 17.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1. NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite consolidation key is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in Fields 2.1 to 5.1 above.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic. ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.   
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 2.1),     then no input is allowed here.   
If a value is entered in this field, the ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 2.1) must     not be null.
The  above validation rules (1, 2, 5) would not be applicable, if Company specific consolidation records (with IDs ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx or PROFIT&amp;LOSS.xxxxxxxxx) had been  defined, since the RE.STAT.NAME records could be attached to RE.STAT.REP.LINE records of either  default or a Company specific Reports, and the validations could differ in each case.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.   
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 2.1),     then no input is allowed here.   
If a value is entered in this field, the ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 2.1) must     not be null.
The  above validation rules (1, 2, 5) would not be applicable, if Company specific consolidation records (with IDs ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx or PROFIT&amp;LOSS.xxxxxxxxx) had been  defined, since the RE.STAT.NAME records could be attached to RE.STAT.REP.LINE records of either  default or a Company specific Reports, and the validations could differ in each case.

Fields 6.1 to 17.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1. NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite consolidation key is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in Fields 2.1 to 5.1 above.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic. ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Validation Rules:

As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET&amp;LIAB record.     Multivalue field(s) associated with fields 2.1 to 5.1 and 7.1 to 18.1.     Optional input.   
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.   
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.   
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.   
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 2.1),     then no input is allowed here.   
If a value is entered in this field, the ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 2.1) must     not be null.
The  above validation rules (1, 2, 5) would not be applicable, if Company specific consolidation records (with IDs ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx or PROFIT&amp;LOSS.xxxxxxxxx) had been  defined, since the RE.STAT.NAME records could be attached to RE.STAT.REP.LINE records of either  default or a Company specific Reports, and the validations could differ in each case.

Example:  When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field.  A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. 
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included.  This match is done by a priority basis.  The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Fields 6.1 to 17.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1.

The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite consolidation key is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in Fields 2.1 to 5.1 above.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Fields 6.1 to 17.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1.

The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite consolidation key is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in Fields 2.1 to 5.1 above.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Fields 6.1 to 17.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1. NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite consolidation key is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in Fields 2.1 to 5.1 above.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included.  This match is done by a priority basis.  The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic. ID. 
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.
