<p><b>Field description:</b>
Identifies any new repayment amount requested on a redemption type contract as a result of the reduced outstanding principal on the contract. 
This field is used to change the repayment amount on a redemption type contract. For these contract types the change in the outstanding balance of the contract, brought about by the input of this payment, will have an effect on future repayments and the final maturity of the contract. The customer may wish to see the periodic repayments on the loan reduced as a result of this redemption; alternatively they may be left at the same level in which case the loan will be repaid earlier. 
If the repayment amount is to be changed then the new desired amount may be entered here. The date on which this new amount becomes effective is entered in the NEW.REPAY.DATE field. If an automatic recalculation of the repayment amount has been requested via the RECALC.REPAYMENT field then the first possible date on which the new repayment amount may come into effect will have already been defaulted into the NEW.REPAY.DATE field. 
Whenever a new repayment amount is requested, either via input to this field or the RECALC.REPAYMENT field, the system will automatically calculate a new theoretical repayment amount. This amount represents the minimum repayment amount required to repay the loan based on the contract parameters on the NEW.REPAY.DATE. This theoretical amount will be inserted in the NEW.THEORETICAL field and used to validate this field. 
A number of new amounts and dates may be entered if required. These amounts are validated in such a way that the contract will always be repaid within the term. If multiple new amounts are present then the intermediate actual amounts may be less than their associated theoretical amounts, however, the final repayment amount must be at least as great as the final theoretical amount. 
It should be noted that this multivalue set of fields, NEW.REPAY.AMT to NEW.THEORETICAL, have equivalent fields on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file. If any new repayment details are present on the contract record at the time of input of a payment then these will be automatically entered on the payment record prior to any user input to that record. 
After authorisation of the payment these fields will be transferred to their equivalents on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file. 
Validation Rules:

1 - 19 numeric characters. Multi value field associated with fields NEW.REPAY.AMT and NEW.REPAY.DATE (optional input for redemption type contracts - NOINPUT for nonredemption contracts)
Input not allowed for SAVING and NONREDEM contracts.
Input must be positive.
Input not allowed without an associated date in the NEW.REPAY.DATE field.
Each repayment amount must be sufficient to repay the accrued interest from the repayment period(s) to which it applies.
The last multivalue of this field must be at least equal to the last multivalue of the associated NEW.THEORETICAL field.
An override will be required for any new repayment amount that differs from the associated theoretical amount.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Specifies the effective date of any new repayment amounts entered in the NEW.REPAY.AMT field. 
For redemption type contracts the change in the outstanding principal balance on the contract will effect the future repayments on that contract and the date of final maturity. The customer of the loan may wish to see the periodic repayment amount of the loan reduced to reflect the lower outstanding balance. Alternatively, he may wish this amount to remain the same thereby bringing forward the maturity date. 
If the repayment amount is to be changed then this field is used to define the date on which the new repayment amount becomes effective. This date may be input manually or defaulted by the system. 
Defaulting of this field is achieved by requesting a recalculation of the repayment amount via the RECALC.REPAYMENT field. In this case the next repayment date after which the principal amount, and in the case of annuity loans the interest rate, have remained unchanged for a full repayment period will be defaulted. 
It should be noted that this multivalue set of fields, NEW.REPAY.AMT to NEW.THEORETICAL, have equivalent fields on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file.

Several new repayment dates and amounts may have been entered in which case a new theoretical amount is calculated for each new date. If the contract type is ANNUITY there may be cases where it is not possible to recalculate the repayment. These arise when there is a change in the principal balance or interest rate of the contract in the middle of a repayment period during which a new  repayment amount has been requested. In this case the theoretical amount will be left blank but an override message will be displayed to inform the user of the problem. It should be noted that this multivalue set of fields, NEW.REPAY.AMT to NEW.THEORETICAL, have equivalent fields on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file.

In this case the next repayment date after which the principal amount, and in the case of annuity loans the interest rate, have remained unchanged for a full repayment period will be defaulted. 
It should be noted that this multivalue set of fields, NEW.REPAY.AMT to NEW.THEORETICAL, have equivalent fields on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file. If any new repayment details are present on the contract record at the time of input of the payment then these will be automatically entered on the payment record prior to any user input to that record. 
After authorisation of the payment these fields will be transferred to their equivalents on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file. 
Validation Rules:

Standard date format. Multivalue field associated with fields RECALC.PAYMENT and NEW.REPAY.DATE. (optional input for redemption type contracts - NOINPUT for non redemption contracts)
Input not allowed for SAVING and NONREDEM contracts.
Dates input must be valid future repayment dates.
Dates must be in ascending order.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Specifies the effective date of any new repayment amounts entered in the NEW.REPAY.AMT field. 
For redemption type contracts the change in the outstanding principal balance on the contract will effect the future repayments on that contract and the date of final maturity. The customer of the loan may wish to see the periodic repayment amount of the loan reduced to reflect the lower outstanding balance. Alternatively, he may wish this amount to remain the same thereby bringing forward the maturity date. 
If the repayment amount is to be changed then this field is used to define the date on which the new repayment amount becomes effective. This date may be input manually or defaulted by the system. 
Defaulting of this field is achieved by requesting a recalculation of the repayment amount via the RECALC.REPAYMENT field. In this case the next repayment date after which the principal amount, and in the case of annuity loans the interest rate, have remained unchanged for a full repayment period will be defaulted.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Defines the minimum repayment amount required for each of the multivalued NEW.REPAY.DATES to ensure that the loan is paid in full within the term of the contract. This field is used by non redemption type contracts only. 
For redemption type contracts the change in the outstanding balance of the contract, brought about by the payment entered, may lead to a recalculation of the repayment amount being requested. If this is the case then the minimum repayment amount required to repay the loan within the term will be calculated during 
Validation Rules:

1 - 19 numeric characters. Multivalue field associated with fields NEW.REPAY.AMT and NEW.REPAY.DATE.  Several new repayment dates and amounts may have been entered in which case a new theoretical amount is calculated for each new date. If the contract type is ANNUITY there may be cases where it is not possible to recalculate the repayment. These arise when there is a change in the principal balance or interest rate of the contract in the middle of a repayment period during which a new  repayment amount has been requested. In this case the theoretical amount will be left blank but an override message will be displayed to inform the user of the problem. It should be noted that this multivalue set of fields, NEW.REPAY.AMT to NEW.THEORETICAL, have equivalent fields on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file. If any new repayment details are present on the contract record at the time of input of the payment then these will be automatically entered on the payment record prior to any user input. After authorisation of the payment these fields will be transferred to their equivalents on the contract record on the MG.MORTGAGE file.
This is a NOINPUT field.
An override will be required for ANNUITY contracts in cases where the annuity amount cannot be recalculated.
