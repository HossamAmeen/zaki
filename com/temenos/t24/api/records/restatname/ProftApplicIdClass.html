Fields 20.1 to 31.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record PROFIT&amp;LOSS (Field 1.1. NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the one standard, fixed component as defined in the field 19.1.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.
This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is PL Category Code, Variable 2 is Product Category Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Fields 20.1 to 31.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record PROFIT&amp;LOSS (Field 1.1. NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the one standard, fixed component as defined in the field 19.1.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.
This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is PL Category Code, Variable 2 is Product Category Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Fields 20.1 to 31.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record PROFIT&amp;LOSS (Field 1.1.

The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the one standard, fixed component as defined in the field 19.1.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.
This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID.

Fields 20.1 to 31.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record PROFIT&amp;LOSS (Field 1.1.

The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the one standard, fixed component as defined in the field 19.1.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.
This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is PL Category Code, Variable 2 is Product Category Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

Fields 20.1 to 31.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record PROFIT&amp;LOSS (Field 1.1. NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the one standard, fixed component as defined in the field 19.1.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.
This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID.

If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts, with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If a value is entered in this field then PROFT APPLIC ID (Field 19.1) must     not be null.
The  above validation rules 1 and 2  would not be applicable, if Company specific consolidation records (with IDs ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx or PROFIT&amp;LOSS.xxxxxxxxx) had been  defined, since the RE.STAT.NAME records could be attached to RE.STAT.REP.LINE records of either  default or a Company specific Reports, and the validations could differ in each case.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Fields 20.1 to 31.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record PROFIT&amp;LOSS (Field 1.1. NAME).
The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the one standard, fixed component as defined in the field 19.1.

Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.
Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.
This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID.
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is PL Category Code, Variable 2 is Product Category Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Defines a currency or a group of currencies to be reported (included) in a given reporting line. 
Example:  When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field.  A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. 
Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.  This match is done by a priority basis.  The priority basis is:- Variable 1,  Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID. 
For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is PL Category Code, Variable 2 is Product Category Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used. 
The following detail report lines have been loaded for the Report Statement of Condition ('SOC').
