<p><b>Field description:</b>
Specifies any new repayment amounts which are required to become effective at a future date. This field is only used for ANNUITY and LINEAR type contracts. 
For redemption type contracts (ANNUITY and LINEAR) it is possible to change the repayment amount a number of times throughout the life of the contract. This can be done in one of two ways, either the new amounts are entered in the REPAYMENT.AMOUNT field immediately prior to them becoming effective,or if known,they can be loaded in advance. This is done via this multi-valued set of "new repayment" fields. In this way any number of future changes may be entered at the same time. 
As well as requesting a change in the repayment amount, a situation may occur whereby the system forces a new repayment amount to be implemented at a future date. This can happen when a future interest rate change is loaded on an annuity contract or an early partial redemption is made via the MG.PAYMENT file.  These new repayment amounts are validated in such a way as to ensure that the contract will always be repaid by the end of the contract term. This is done by calculating a new theoretical repayment amount for each date on which a change in the repayment is requested. This is then compared to the actual repayment amount entered. In all cases the final repayment amount must be at least equal to the final theoretical amount. However, intermediate repayments may be for less than their associated theoretical amount. 
The details from the "new repayment" fields are transferred to the "current fields" when the next repayment date on the contract becomes equal to the new repay date. This transfer is performed as a part of the end of day batch process. 
The way in which these fields can be used is illustrated in the following examples: 
Examples: 
           (i)  Temporary change in repayment amount                 requested.            Contract type      : LINEAR            Principal          : 120,000            Term               : 60 months (5 years)            Repayment date     : 31/01/90 M0131 (monthly)            Repayment amount   : 2000            Theoretical amount : 2000 
           New repay date     : 31/01/9131/01/92            New theoretical    : 2000   2250            New repay amt      : 1000   2250 
           In this case the repayment amount has been lowered for            a year to a level below the theoretical amount. The            following year it is increased again to a level allowing he            shortfall from the previous year to be made up over the            remaining life of the contract. An override will be            required for the new repay of 1000 as this is less than            the theoretical. 
           The new repayment details, effective on 31/01/91, will be            transferred to the current repayment fields after the            repayment of 31/12/90 when the repayment date is cycled            forward and becomes equal to the new repay date. 
           (ii) Recalculation of annuity required due to a future                 interest rate change 
           Contract type      : ANNUITY            Principal          : 120,000            Term               : 60 Months (5 years)            Interest rate      : 10%            Repayment date     : 31/01/90 M0131 (monthly)            Repayment amount   : 2549.65            Theoretical amount : 2549.65            New interest rate  : 11%            New int eff date   : 20/01/91 
           New repay date     : 31/03/91            New theoretical    : 2598.93            New repay amt      : 2598.93 
           In this example a new repayment date and theoretical            amount have been created by the system as a result of the            rate change on 21/01/91. The new amount will not become            effective until 31/03/91.            This is due to the fact that the rate change falls in the            middle of the repayment period ending 31/1/91 and            therefore two interest rates apply in this period. Because            of this it is not possible to calculate a new annuity for            that period. The new annuity is calculated for the first            full repayment period during which a single rate applies            for the whole of that period.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Defines the minimum repayment amount required at each new repayment date to ensure that the loan is fully repaid within the contract term. This field is used by ANNUITY and LINEAR type contracts only. 
This field is only used for ANNUITY and LINEAR contracts when a future change in the repayment amount is required. These future changes in the repayment amount are entered in this multi-valued set of fields. 
The date on which each new repayment amount becomes effective is held in the NEW.REPAY.DATE field. On each of these dates a new repayment amount is calculated by the system during validation and inserted in this field. This amount represents the minimum repayment amount required to repay the loan within the term and is based on the contract parameters on the effective date. 
Further details of how these amounts are calculated can be found in the Helptext for the REPAYMENT.AMOUNT field. 
If the contract type is ANNUITY, there may be cases where it is not possible to recalculate the repayment amount. These arise when there is a change in the principal balance or interest rate of the contract in the middle of a repayment period, and a new date and repayment amount has been requested for that period. In this case the theoretical amount will be left blank but an override message will be displayed to inform the user of the problem.

This is a NO INPUT field.
An override will be required for ANNUITY contracts in cases where it is not possible to calculate an annuity amount.

This field may be updated manually by the user or automatically defaulted by the system. Defaulting occurs when a future interest rate change is loaded on an ANNUITY contract, or an early partial redemption is made via the MG.PAYMENT file. 
Validation Rules:

Standard date format. Multi-value field associated with fields  NEW.UP.TO.PRIN  to NEW.THEORETICAL. (mandatory input if NEW.REPAY.AMOUNT entered)
Input not allowed for SAVING and NONREDEM type contracts.
Dates input must be valid future repayment dates.
Dates must be input in ascending order and cannot be duplicated.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Specifies any new repayment amounts which are required to become effective at a future date. This field is only used for ANNUITY and LINEAR type contracts. 
For redemption type contracts (ANNUITY and LINEAR) it is possible to change the repayment amount a number of times throughout the life of the contract. This can be done in one of two ways, either the new amounts are entered in the REPAYMENT.AMOUNT field immediately prior to them becoming effective,or if known,they can be loaded in advance. This is done via this multi-valued set of "new repayment" fields. In this way any number of future changes may be entered at the same time. 
As well as requesting a change in the repayment amount, a situation may occur whereby the system forces a new repayment amount to be implemented at a future date. This can happen when a future interest rate change is loaded on an annuity contract or an early partial redemption is made via the MG.PAYMENT file.  These new repayment amounts are validated in such a way as to ensure that the contract will always be repaid by the end of the contract term. This is done by calculating a new theoretical repayment amount for each date on which a change in the repayment is requested. This is then compared to the actual repayment amount entered. In all cases the final repayment amount must be at least equal to the final theoretical amount. However, intermediate repayments may be for less than their associated theoretical amount. 
The details from the "new repayment" fields are transferred to the "current fields" when the next repayment date on the contract becomes equal to the new repay date. This transfer is performed as a part of the end of day batch process. 
The way in which these fields can be used is illustrated in the following examples: 
Examples: 
           (i)  Temporary change in repayment amount                 requested.            Contract type      : LINEAR            Principal          : 120,000            Term               : 60 months (5 years)            Repayment date     : 31/01/90 M0131 (monthly)            Repayment amount   : 2000            Theoretical amount : 2000 
           New repay date     : 31/01/9131/01/92            New theoretical    : 2000   2250            New repay amt      : 1000   2250 
           In this case the repayment amount has been lowered for            a year to a level below the theoretical amount. The            following year it is increased again to a level allowing he            shortfall from the previous year to be made up over the            remaining life of the contract. An override will be            required for the new repay of 1000 as this is less than            the theoretical. 
           The new repayment details, effective on 31/01/91, will be            transferred to the current repayment fields after the            repayment of 31/12/90 when the repayment date is cycled            forward and becomes equal to the new repay date. 
           (ii) Recalculation of annuity required due to a future                 interest rate change 
           Contract type      : ANNUITY            Principal          : 120,000            Term               : 60 Months (5 years)            Interest rate      : 10%            Repayment date     : 31/01/90 M0131 (monthly)            Repayment amount   : 2549.65            Theoretical amount : 2549.65            New interest rate  : 11%            New int eff date   : 20/01/91 
           New repay date     : 31/03/91            New theoretical    : 2598.93            New repay amt      : 2598.93 
           In this example a new repayment date and theoretical            amount have been created by the system as a result of the            rate change on 21/01/91. The new amount will not become            effective until 31/03/91.            This is due to the fact that the rate change falls in the            middle of the repayment period ending 31/1/91 and            therefore two interest rates apply in this period. Because            of this it is not possible to calculate a new annuity for            that period. The new annuity is calculated for the first            full repayment period during which a single rate applies            for the whole of that period.

Defines the minimum repayment amount required at each new repayment date to ensure that the loan is fully repaid within the contract term. This field is used by ANNUITY and LINEAR type contracts only. 
This field is only used for ANNUITY and LINEAR contracts when a future change in the repayment amount is required. These future changes in the repayment amount are entered in this multi-valued set of fields. 
The date on which each new repayment amount becomes effective is held in the NEW.REPAY.DATE field. On each of these dates a new repayment amount is calculated by the system during validation and inserted in this field. This amount represents the minimum repayment amount required to repay the loan within the term and is based on the contract parameters on the effective date. 
Further details of how these amounts are calculated can be found in the Helptext for the REPAYMENT.AMOUNT field. 
If the contract type is ANNUITY, there may be cases where it is not possible to recalculate the repayment amount. These arise when there is a change in the principal balance or interest rate of the contract in the middle of a repayment period, and a new date and repayment amount has been requested for that period. In this case the theoretical amount will be left blank but an override message will be displayed to inform the user of the problem.
