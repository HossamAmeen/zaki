<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field.  Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. 
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field. 
Validation Rules:

4 lines of 35 characters.  Multivalue field associated with field range OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY to REC.ADV.NARR.
Input is not allowed when a beneficiary number has been entered.
Input is only allowed when OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY is a Nostro account.
Input is not allowed for deal sub-types 'BR' and 'IN'.
Input is restricted to four lines of 35 characters.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Identifies the bank to which the counterparty wishes the amount sold to be paid.  This will either be the bank of the counterparty or the bank of their nominated beneficiary. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract.  This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO field.  If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved.  As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. 
Validation Rules:

Up to 4 lines of 35 character narrative.  Multivalue field associated with field range OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY to REC.ADV.NARR.
Input is not allowed when a correspondent number has been entered.
Input is only allowed when Our Account Pay is a Nostro account.
Input is not allowed for deal sub-types 'BR' and 'IN'.
Input is restricted to four lines of 35 characters.
Input in this field or the previous one (counterparty Corr No) is mandatory when Our Account Pay represents a Nostro account and no autorouting details (settlement instructions) exist on the Agency file for the counterparty of the deal.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field.  Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. 
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field.

If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved.  As an example, let us say that the BANK 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses BANK 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent.  When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the Cparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. 
Validation Rules:

1-6 numeric characters Customer Number        or 3-10 character customer mnemonic (uppercase alphanumeric or '.') -      Type MNE.  (Input in this field is optional.  Default value = counterparty.)  Multivalue field associated with field range OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY to REC.ADV.NARR.
Input must represent a valid customer on the Customer file.
Input in this field is not allowed when details have been entered in the beneficiary address field.
Input is only allowed when Our Account pay represents a Nostro account.
Input is not acceptable for Negotiated or other internal deals.
Input is not allowed unless the counterparty is known (i.e. deal sub-type is not 'BR').

This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field.  Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. 
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.

The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Identifies the bank to which the counterparty wishes the amount sold to be paid.  This will either be the bank of the counterparty or the bank of their nominated beneficiary. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract.  This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO field.  If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved.  As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

Identifies the account through which the currency sold is to be settled and forms part of a set of associated fields. 
After a deal has been struck, the two parties must decide where the currency bought is to be received and where the currency sold is to be paid.  This field is used to identify which account in our books will be credited to remit the currency sold. 
When no input has been entered in this field, the system will proceed as follows: 
      a) In a first stage, the application will check if the counterparty          has specific instructions defined on the Agency table for the          currency sold.  If yes, the existing conditions will be followed.          Otherwise, 
      b) In a second stage, the FOREX application will check in the          internal file CUSTOMER.CCY.ACCT if the counterparty with whom the          bank is making the deal has an account in that currency (i.e.          currency sold).  If yes, this customer account will then be          credited.  If the counterparty does not maintain an account in          the sale currency with the bank, 
      c) The FOREX application will then, in a third stage, find in the          table NOSTRO.ACCOUNT the relevant Nostro account for the currency          being sold.  If this account exists on the Nostro table, it will          then be used to record the credit accounting entry.  If at the          Nostro table more than one Nostro exists per currency, the system          will default to the first account listed. However, the user has          the ability to select which Nostro account by entering 'A' to          give the first, 'B' to give the second and so forth.  If no          account is defined on the Nostro table, 
      d) The user will then need to enter an account number which can be a          customer account, a Nostro account or an internal account.  The          internal account details must be present on the FX.TEXT table.          Input to this field for internal accounts must be entered in the          format 1 to give the first account: 2 to give the second and so          forth as detailed on the FX.TEXT table.For option type contracts internal account is defaulted from suspense category code defined in FX.TRANSACTION.TYPE. 
         An input of a customer account which does not pertain to the          counterparty will request an override except if the account is a          Nostro account.  (Since in an option forward contract there may          be several delivery dates, the override message prompted to the          user will indicate for which delivery set (D.S.#) the override is          required.) 
In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg. Customer.id in MONEYMARKET,Counterparty in FOREX, etc.) has a record in CUSTOMER.SSI application, then the account number in this field gets defaulted as per the definition for that Customer from CUSTOMER.SSI. For more information on the usage of this feature please refer to CUSTOMER.SSI application.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field.  Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. 
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field.

We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field.  Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. 
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field.

<p><b>Field description:</b>
This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. 
Entry in this field will be accepted where the beneficiary is known to the bank (i.e. there is a customer record for the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is not known to us, the beneficiary details may be entered in the Beneficiary address field. 
Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the Our Account Pay field. 
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 
To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the Our Account Pay field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the Our Account Pay field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved.  As an example, let us say that the BANK 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses BANK 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent.  When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the Cparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. 
Validation Rules:

1-6 numeric characters Customer Number        or 3-10 character customer mnemonic (uppercase alphanumeric or '.') -      Type MNE.  (Input in this field is optional.  Default value = counterparty.)  Multivalue field associated with field range OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY to REC.ADV.NARR.
Input must represent a valid customer on the Customer file.
Input in this field is not allowed when details have been entered in the beneficiary address field.
Input is only allowed when Our Account pay represents a Nostro account.
Input is not acceptable for Negotiated or other internal deals.
Input is not allowed unless the counterparty is known (i.e. deal sub-type is not 'BR').

<p><b>Field description:</b>
Contains the account number of the counterparty or nominated beneficiary at their correspondent bank. 
The field will be used to provide the correspondent with the necessary details to credit the counterparty's or beneficiary's account. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract.  This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. 
If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO No field.  If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us ===================== We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas ====================================== To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally ===================================== Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the counterparty ==================================== The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank ================================ Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved.  As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ in Hong Kong as their dollar agent.  When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the counterparty correspondent), account  Bank ABC (the counterparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

Identifies any intermediary bank involved in the transaction and will be specified by the counterparty. 
If the intermediary is known to us (i.e. their is an associated customer record), the customer number of the intermediary bank should be entered in the INTERMED.BK.NO field.  If not, details should be entered in this field. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract.  This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. 
If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the counterparty Corr No field.  If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 

To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 

To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 

To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  Details of the CPARTY's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 

To a beneficiary of the CPARTY 
The CPARTY may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 

Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the CPARTY may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the CPARTY or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent.  When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' in HK (the CPARTY correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the CPARTY or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

If the intermediary is known to us (i.e. their is an associated customer record), the customer number of the intermediary bank will be entered in this field. If not, details should be entered in the INTERMED.ADD field. 
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. 
If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. 
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: 
To an account with us 
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. 
To an account at another bank overseas 
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. 
To an account at another bank locally 
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. 
To a beneficiary of the counterparty 
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. 
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. 
Payment via an intermediary bank 
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' HK (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

Identifies the account through which the currency sold is to be settled and forms part of a set of associated fields. 
After a deal has been struck, the two parties must decide where the currency bought is to be received and where the currency sold is to be paid.  This field is used to identify which account in our books will be credited to remit the currency sold. 
When no input has been entered in this field, the system will proceed as follows: 
      a) In a first stage, the application will check if the counterparty          has specific instructions defined on the Agency table for the          currency sold.  If yes, the existing conditions will be followed.          Otherwise, 
      b) In a second stage, the FOREX application will check in the          internal file CUSTOMER.CCY.ACCT if the counterparty with whom the          bank is making the deal has an account in that currency (i.e.          currency sold).  If yes, this customer account will then be          credited.  If the counterparty does not maintain an account in          the sale currency with the bank, 
      c) The FOREX application will then, in a third stage, find in the          table NOSTRO.ACCOUNT the relevant Nostro account for the currency          being sold.  If this account exists on the Nostro table, it will          then be used to record the credit accounting entry.  If at the          Nostro table more than one Nostro exists per currency, the system          will default to the first account listed. However, the user has          the ability to select which Nostro account by entering 'A' to          give the first, 'B' to give the second and so forth.  If no          account is defined on the Nostro table, 
      d) The user will then need to enter an account number which can be a          customer account, a Nostro account or an internal account.  The          internal account details must be present on the FX.TEXT table.          Input to this field for internal accounts must be entered in the          format 1 to give the first account: 2 to give the second and so          forth as detailed on the FX.TEXT table.For option type contracts internal account is defaulted from suspense category code defined in FX.TRANSACTION.TYPE. 
         An input of a customer account which does not pertain to the          counterparty will request an override except if the account is a          Nostro account.  (Since in an option forward contract there may          be several delivery dates, the override message prompted to the          user will indicate for which delivery set (D.S.#) the override is          required.) 
In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg. Customer.id in MONEYMARKET,Counterparty in FOREX, etc.) has a record in CUSTOMER.SSI application, then the account number in this field gets defaulted as per the definition for that Customer from CUSTOMER.SSI. For more information on the usage of this feature please refer to CUSTOMER.SSI application.
